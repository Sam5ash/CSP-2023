    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <h3>My name is <strong>Samuel Fivaz</strong> and I am 17 years old. I was born in a country called <strong>South Africa</strong> and moved to <strong>England</strong> once I was 5. I lived in <strong>England</strong> for 4 years but once I moved to <strong>America</strong> I knew that this would be my favorite place to live in. It was hard at first but after 8 years of living here I don't regret a thing. I like to go to the <strong>beach</strong> and hangout with my <strong>friends</strong>. My favorite food at the moment is <strong>L&L Hawaiian BBQ</strong>, and my favorite tv show is <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>. Now that you know a bit about me here are some pictures of my <strong>family</strong> and I and a few of my <strong>hobbies</strong>.
