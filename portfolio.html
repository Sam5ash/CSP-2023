	<h2>This is my pizza project. The name of the game was to enter the pizzeria, which is the image you are seeing right now. After entering you would be welcomed by a pizza making station where you would make your pizza. You would get asked questions of what toppings, chees, and sauce you wanted on your pizza. After making your pizza and going through the whole process of making the pizza you would be asked if you were done. If you were your pizza would be put into a box and a message would pop up saying goodbye and thanks.</h2>

	<h2>This is my project for 1.2.5. This is a game where you can select the different maps or locations to play and the difficulty that you would like. In each map there is a boundry that the turtle cannot go past. If the player does reach the boundry the turtle would just bounce off the opposite way. There are bombs that randomly generate in the boundry and a peice of kelp. The name of the game is to avoid the bombs and get to the kelp before the time runs out. If you hit the bomb the game ends, if you run out of time the game ends, so the only way to win is to get to the Kelp and survive.</h2>
