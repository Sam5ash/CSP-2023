	<h2>This is my pizza project. The name of the game was to enter the pizzeria, which is the image you are seeing right now. After entering you would be welcomed by a pizza making station where you would make your pizza. You would get asked questions of what toppings, chees, and sauce you wanted on your pizza. After making your pizza and going through the whole process of making the pizza you would be asked if you were done. If you were your pizza would be put into a box and a message would pop up saying goodbye and thanks.</h2>
